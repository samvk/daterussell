        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Your privacy here at DateMatthew.com is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected. (Probably dating.)</li>
            <li>We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.</li>
            <li>We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.</li>
            <li>We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</li>
            <li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.</li>
            <li>This is a gag website. You probably shouldn't actually submit anything unless you know Matthew personally. So yeah.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are committed to conducting DateMatthew in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.</p>
